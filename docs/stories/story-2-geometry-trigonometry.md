# Math Genius MCP Tools - Story 2: Geometry and Trigonometry Tools

## Story Title
**Geometry and Trigonometry Tools - MCP Integration**

## User Story
As a **developer**,
I want **geometry and trigonometry mathematical tools**,
So that **I can build applications that solve geometric calculations, trigonometric functions, and spatial problem-solving tasks**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Mathematical tool library (building on Story 1)
- Technology: Python/Node.js backend with mathematical libraries
- Follows pattern: Clean API design with standardized input/output formats established in Story 1
- Touch points: Mathematical function interfaces, result formatting, coordinate systems, error handling

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Geometric Calculations:** Tool supports area, perimeter, volume calculations for standard shapes (triangles, circles, rectangles, spheres, cylinders, etc.)
2. **Trigonometric Functions:** Tool supports sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, and their hyperbolic variants with degree/radian conversion
3. **Coordinate Geometry:** Tool supports distance calculations, midpoint finding, slope calculations, and line intersections
4. **Spatial Problem Solving:** Tool supports angle calculations, geometric transformations, and basic vector operations

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Mathematical tools from Story 1 continue to work unchanged
6. New geometric functions follow existing API design patterns
7. Mathematical tool library maintains backward compatibility
8. Coordinate system handling is consistent across all geometric functions

**Quality Requirements:**
9. All geometric and trigonometric operations are covered by comprehensive test cases
10. Mathematical tool documentation includes usage examples with visual representations where helpful
11. No breaking changes to existing mathematical function interfaces

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing mathematical tool library with geometric and trigonometric functions
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow clean API design patterns from Story 1 with geometric-specific parameter validation
- **Key Constraints:** Handle multiple coordinate systems, angle unit conversions, floating-point precision for geometric calculations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Geometric calculation functions (area, perimeter, volume) implemented for standard shapes
- [ ] Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, inverse functions) implemented with unit conversion

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Floating-point precision issues in geometric calculations and coordinate transformations
- **Mitigation:** Use established geometric libraries, implement tolerance-based comparisons, comprehensive test cases with known geometric results
- **Rollback:** Modular architecture allows disabling specific geometric functions if issues arise

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing mathematical function APIs or Story 1 tools
- [ ] Function additions are purely additive to mathematical library
- [ ] Geometric functions follow standard response formats
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible for geometric operations

## Validation Checklist
