# Task 5: Error Handling & Response Formatting

**Description:**
Implement comprehensive error handling for mathematical operations and MCP communication, with standardized response formatting for all mathematical results.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create standardized mathematical result format for MCP responses
- [ ] Implement mathematical error handling (domain errors, precision issues, convergence problems)
- [ ] Create MCP-compliant error responses for all error types
- [ ] Implement error categorization (validation errors, mathematical errors, server errors)
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging and debugging support for MCP operations
- [ ] Create error recovery mechanisms for non-fatal mathematical issues
- [ ] Implement response formatting for complex mathematical objects
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and timeout handling for computationally intensive operations

**Next:** Proceed to Task 6: Testing, Documentation & Deployment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Standardized mathematical result format implemented for all MCP responses
- [ ] Mathematical error handling covers domain errors, precision issues, and convergence problems
- [ ] MCP-compliant error responses implemented for all error types
- [ ] Error categorization system distinguishes validation, mathematical, and server errors
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and debugging support implemented for MCP operations
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms handle non-fatal mathematical issues gracefully
- [ ] Response formatting handles complex mathematical objects (matrices, expressions, statistical results)
- [ ] Performance monitoring and timeout handling implemented for intensive operations
- [ ] All error messages are clear, actionable, and user-friendly

**Notes:**
- Use mathgenius core error handling as the foundation for MCP error responses
- Implement proper MCP error response format following protocol specifications
- Handle mathematical domain errors (division by zero, invalid domains, undefined operations)
- Provide clear error messages that help users understand and fix issues
- Implement timeout handling for computationally intensive operations to prevent server hanging
