# Task 6: Testing, Documentation & Deployment

**Description:**
Implement comprehensive testing for MCP integration, create documentation for MCP server usage, and prepare the mgenius-mcp component for deployment.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for mgenius-mcp component
- [ ] Implement MCP protocol compliance tests with test clients
- [ ] Create integration tests that verify MCP tools work with mathgenius dispatcher
- [ ] Implement performance tests for mathematical operations via MCP
- [ ] Create load testing for concurrent MCP requests
- [ ] Document MCP server setup, configuration, and deployment
- [ ] Create usage examples for each mathematical tool category via MCP
- [ ] Document troubleshooting guide for common MCP integration issues
- [ ] Prepare deployment configuration and containerization
- [ ] Create MCP client examples and integration guides

**Next:** Story 4 Complete - MCP Integration Ready for Production

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covers all mgenius-mcp functionality
- [ ] MCP protocol compliance tests verify server follows MCP standards
- [ ] Integration tests confirm MCP tools work correctly with mathgenius dispatcher
- [ ] Performance tests validate response times for mathematical operations
- [ ] Load testing confirms server handles concurrent MCP requests efficiently
- [ ] Complete documentation covers MCP server setup, configuration, and deployment
- [ ] Usage examples demonstrate each mathematical tool category via MCP
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide addresses common MCP integration issues
- [ ] Deployment configuration ready for production environments
- [ ] MCP client examples and integration guides available for developers

**Notes:**
- Follow existing test patterns from Stories 1-3 for consistency
- Test MCP protocol compliance with standard MCP test clients
- Include performance benchmarks for mathematical operations
- Document deployment options (containerization, cloud deployment, etc.)
- Create clear examples for developers integrating with MCP server
- Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and comprehensive
