# Task 2: Tool Discovery & Registration System

**Description:**
Implement automatic discovery and registration system that finds all MathGenius mathematical functions from the dispatcher and registers them as MCP tools with proper categorization.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create tools.py with MCP tool definitions for all mathematical operations
- [ ] Implement tool discovery mechanism that inspects mathgenius.api.dispatcher
- [ ] Create tool categorization system (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, advanced)
- [ ] Implement automatic MCP tool registration from discovered functions
- [ ] Create tool metadata extraction from function signatures and docstrings
- [ ] Implement tool naming convention following MCP standards
- [ ] Integrate tool discovery with FastMCP server initialization

**Next:** Proceed to Task 3: JSON Schema Generation & Validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `mgenius-mcp/tools.py` contains MCP tool definitions for all mathematical operations
- [ ] Tool discovery mechanism automatically finds all dispatcher functions
- [ ] Tool categorization system organizes tools by mathematical domain
- [ ] Automatic MCP tool registration works for all discovered functions
- [ ] Tool metadata extraction captures function signatures, parameters, and descriptions
- [ ] Tool naming convention follows MCP standards and mathematical operation purpose
- [ ] All mathematical tools from Stories 1-3 are discoverable and registered
- [ ] Tool registration integrates seamlessly with FastMCP server

**Notes:**
- Use reflection/introspection to discover dispatcher functions automatically
- Implement robust tool categorization based on function module and name patterns
- Ensure tool names are clear and descriptive for MCP clients
- Create tool metadata from existing function docstrings and type hints
- Handle edge cases where functions might not have complete metadata

## QA Test Cases

- Verify `mgenius-mcp/tools.py` contains definitions for all mathematical operations
- Test tool discovery mechanism finds all functions from mathgenius.api.dispatcher
- Confirm tool categorization correctly organizes tools by mathematical domain
- Test automatic MCP tool registration for all discovered functions
- Validate tool metadata extraction captures complete function information
- Test tool naming convention follows MCP standards and is descriptive
- Verify all mathematical tools from Stories 1-3 are discoverable and registered
- Test tool registration integrates properly with FastMCP server
- Ensure tool discovery handles functions with incomplete metadata gracefully
- Test that new functions added to dispatcher are automatically discovered
