# Task 1: MCP Server Foundation & Project Structure

**Description:**
Set up the mgenius-mcp module as a separate component at root level following Architecture.md design, with FastMCP framework integration and basic server configuration.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create mgenius-mcp directory structure at root level (separate from mathgenius)
- [ ] Set up pyproject.toml for MCP package with FastMCP dependencies
- [ ] Create server.py with FastMCP server implementation
- [ ] Implement basic MCP server configuration and startup
- [ ] Create config.py for MCP server configuration management
- [ ] Set up logging and health check endpoints
- [ ] Verify MCP protocol compliance and server initialization

**Next:** Proceed to Task 2: Tool Discovery & Registration System

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `mgenius-mcp/` directory created at root level (same level as mathgenius)
- [ ] `mgenius-mcp/pyproject.toml` configured with FastMCP and required dependencies
- [ ] `mgenius-mcp/server.py` implements FastMCP server with basic configuration
- [ ] `mgenius-mcp/config.py` provides configuration management for MCP server
- [ ] Server starts successfully and responds to basic MCP protocol requests
- [ ] Logging system implemented for MCP server operations
- [ ] Health check endpoint confirms server operational status
- [ ] MCP protocol compliance verified with test client

**Notes:**
- Follow Architecture.md section 9.2 for MCP component structure
- Maintain clean separation between mgenius-mcp and mathgenius components
- Use FastMCP framework for rapid MCP-compliant server development
- Implement proper error handling for server startup and configuration issues
- Ensure server can be deployed independently from core mathgenius library

---

## QA Test Cases

- Verify `mgenius-mcp/` directory structure matches Architecture.md specifications
- Test `mgenius-mcp/pyproject.toml` includes all required FastMCP dependencies
- Confirm `mgenius-mcp/server.py` implements FastMCP server correctly
- Test server startup and basic MCP protocol response handling
- Validate `mgenius-mcp/config.py` provides proper configuration management
- Test logging system captures MCP server operations and errors
- Verify health check endpoint returns proper server status
- Test MCP protocol compliance with standard MCP test client
- Ensure clean separation between mgenius-mcp and mathgenius components
- Test server can start and operate independently from mathgenius library changes
