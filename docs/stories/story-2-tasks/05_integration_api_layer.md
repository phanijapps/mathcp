# Task 5: Integration & API Layer

**Description:**
Integrate all geometry and trigonometry modules with the existing mathematical tool library API, ensuring backward compatibility and consistent API design patterns from Story 1.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Update api/dispatcher.py to include geometry and trigonometry functions
- [ ] Ensure all new functions follow existing API design patterns
- [ ] Implement consistent response formatting for geometric functions
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility with Story 1 arithmetic and algebra functions
- [ ] Update main module imports to include geometry functionality
- [ ] Integrate new validation rules specific to geometric parameters

**Next:** Proceed to Task 6: Testing & Documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `api/dispatcher.py` includes all geometry and trigonometry functions
- [ ] All new functions follow existing API design patterns from Story 1
- [ ] Response formatting is consistent across all mathematical functions
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing mathematical function interfaces
- [ ] Main module imports updated to include geometry functionality
- [ ] Geometric parameter validation integrated with existing validation framework
- [ ] Mathematical tool library maintains backward compatibility

**Notes:**
- Follow exact API patterns established in Story 1 for consistency
- Ensure all geometric functions are accessible through the unified API
- Maintain existing function signatures and response formats
- Test integration thoroughly to prevent breaking changes

---

## QA Test Cases

- Verify `api/dispatcher.py` includes all implemented geometry and trigonometry functions
- Test that all new functions follow existing API design patterns
- Confirm response formatting is consistent with Story 1 functions
- Validate that existing Story 1 functions still work unchanged
- Test main module imports and ensure geometry functionality is accessible
- Verify geometric parameter validation works with existing validation framework
- Test backward compatibility by running existing Story 1 tests
- Ensure unified API provides access to all mathematical functions
- Test that API responses follow standardized format across all function types
