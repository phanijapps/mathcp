# Task 6: Testing & Documentation

**Description:**
Implement comprehensive test coverage for all geometry and trigonometry operations and create documentation with usage examples and geometric diagrams where applicable.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for geometry/shapes.py
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for geometry/trigonometry.py  
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for geometry/coordinates.py
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for geometry/spatial.py
- [ ] Create integration tests for API layer functionality
- [ ] Update documentation with geometry and trigonometry usage examples
- [ ] Add geometric diagrams and visual representations where helpful
- [ ] Ensure all test cases cover edge cases and error conditions

**Next:** Story 2 Complete - Ready for User Acceptance Testing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all geometric calculation functions
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all trigonometric functions
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all coordinate geometry functions
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all spatial operation functions
- [ ] Integration tests validate API layer functionality
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples with visual representations
- [ ] Test cases cover all edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] All tests pass and maintain backward compatibility with Story 1

**Notes:**
- Follow existing test patterns from Story 1 tests
- Include known mathematical examples and expected results
- Test floating-point precision handling thoroughly
- Create visual documentation where geometric concepts benefit from diagrams
- Ensure test coverage meets or exceeds Story 1 test coverage standards
