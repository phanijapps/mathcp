# Story 1.0: Intelligent MCP Server with Search and Execute Tools

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system architect,
**I want** to create a new intelligent MCP server that replaces 85+ individual tools with 2 smart tools (search and execute),
**so that** users can discover and use mathematical functions through natural language rather than browsing overwhelming tool lists.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **New MCP Server Architecture**: Create intelligent MCP server that exposes only `search_tool` and `execute_tool`
2. **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintain existing mathematical function capabilities while providing new interface
3. **Tool Migration**: Replace current 85+ individual MCP tool registrations with intelligent 2-tool interface
4. **Performance Improvement**: Reduce MCP protocol overhead and improve user experience
5. **Documentation Update**: Update MCP client documentation to reflect new 2-tool interface
6. **Configuration Management**: Support both legacy and intelligent modes via configuration
7. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive testing of search → execute workflow
8. **Client Migration**: Provide migration path for existing MCP clients
9. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring and analytics for intelligent tool usage patterns

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration
- **Integrates with**: Complete mgenius-mcp server architecture, search and execute tool implementations
- **Technology**: Python 3.12, FastMCP, ChromaDB, sentence-transformers
- **Follows pattern**: Existing MCP server initialization and configuration patterns
- **Touch points**: MCPServer class, configuration system, tool registration system

### Architecture Context
This story represents the culmination of the intelligent MCP interface outlined in the architecture documentation:

**Key Architectural Change:**
Transform from 85+ individual MCP tools to 2 intelligent tools:
- `search_tool(query: str, limit: int = 5) -> List[ToolSearchResult]`
- `execute_tool(tool_name: str, parameters: Dict[str, Any]) -> ToolExecutionResult`

**Server Modes:**
- **Legacy Mode**: Current behavior with 85+ individual tools registered
- **Intelligent Mode**: New behavior with only search_tool and execute_tool registered

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Both modes supported simultaneously via configuration
2. Clients can migrate gradually to intelligent interface
3. Performance and usability benefits demonstrate value
4. Eventually deprecate legacy mode

### System Integration Points
**Dependencies on Previous Stories:**
- Story 1.1 (Search Tool): Provides search_tool implementation
- Story 1.2 (Execute Tool): Provides execute_tool implementation

**Integration Components:**
- Existing `server.py` MCPServer class will be enhanced
- Current `tools.py` ToolRegistry will support both modes
- Existing `config.py` will add intelligent mode options
- Current monitoring and error handling will be extended

### Configuration Design
```python
# Environment variables for intelligent mode
MCP_INTELLIGENT_MODE=true          # Enable intelligent interface
MCP_LEGACY_SUPPORT=false          # Disable legacy tool registration
MCP_SEARCH_INDEX_STARTUP=true     # Build search index at startup
MCP_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true   # Enhanced monitoring
```

### Migration Benefits
**User Experience:**
- Simplified discovery through natural language search
- Reduced cognitive load (2 tools vs 85+ tools)
- Progressive learning of available capabilities
- Better discoverability of relevant mathematical functions

**Technical Benefits:**
- Reduced MCP protocol overhead
- Easier client integration and maintenance
- Scalable architecture for adding new mathematical functions
- Enhanced monitoring and usage analytics

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `mgenius-mcp/tests/test_intelligent_server.py`
- **Test standards**: pytest with async support, 95%+ coverage requirement
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov
- **Specific requirements**:
  - End-to-end workflow testing (search → execute)
  - Configuration mode testing (intelligent vs legacy)
  - Performance comparison testing
  - Client migration scenario testing
  - Monitoring and analytics validation
