# Task 7: Testing & Quality Assurance

**Description:**
Develop a comprehensive test suite and ensure high code quality for all modules.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Pytest-based test suite with >90% coverage for arithmetic and algebra modules
- [ ] Tests for input validation, error handling, and edge cases
- [ ] Test results documented and reviewed


**Notes:**
- All tests should be automated and repeatable.
- Quality standards must be maintained throughout development.
