# Task 4: Implement Algebraic Functions

**Description:**
Implement algebraic functions including equation solving and polynomial operations in the algebra module.

**Progress Notes:**
- [x] algebra/equations.py implements linear and quadratic equation solving
- [x] algebra/polynomials.py implements expand, factor, simplify
- [x] All functions use centralized validation and error handling
- [x] Unit tests in tests/test_algebra.py cover all cases

**Next:** Proceed to Task 5: Unified API Layer (Internal)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `algebra/equations.py` implements equation solving (linear, quadratic)
- [ ] `algebra/polynomials.py` implements polynomial operations (expand, factor, simplify)
- [ ] Functions use validation and error handling from core
- [ ] Unit tests in `tests/test_algebra.py` cover all cases


**Notes:**
- Use established libraries (e.g., SymPy) for symbolic math.
- Ensure all functions are well-documented and tested.

## QA Test Cases

- Verify `algebra/equations.py` implements linear and quadratic equation solving.
- Check `algebra/polynomials.py` for polynomial operations (expand, factor, simplify).
- Ensure all functions use centralized validation and error handling.
- Confirm unit tests in `tests/test_algebra.py` cover all cases, including edge cases and error scenarios.
