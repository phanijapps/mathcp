# Task 3: Statistics & Probability Module

**Description:**
Implement statistics and probability functions including descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create advanced/statistics.py module with statistical functions
- [ ] Implement descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
- [ ] Implement probability distributions (normal, binomial, poisson, chi-square, t-distribution)
- [ ] Implement hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA)
- [ ] Implement regression analysis (linear, polynomial, multiple regression)
- [ ] Implement correlation and covariance calculations
- [ ] Implement statistical sampling and confidence intervals
- [ ] Integrate with existing core validation and error handling

**Next:** Proceed to Task 4: Symbolic Mathematics Module

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `advanced/statistics.py` implements descriptive statistics functions
- [ ] `advanced/statistics.py` implements probability distributions with PDF, CDF, and sampling
- [ ] `advanced/statistics.py` implements hypothesis testing functions (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA)
- [ ] `advanced/statistics.py` implements regression analysis (linear, polynomial, multiple)
- [ ] Correlation and covariance calculations implemented
- [ ] Statistical sampling and confidence interval calculations implemented
- [ ] All functions use centralized input validation from `core/validation.py`
- [ ] Functions handle edge cases (small samples, outliers, distribution assumptions)

**Notes:**
- Use SciPy.stats for statistical distributions and hypothesis testing
- Use NumPy for efficient numerical computations on datasets
- Implement proper error handling for statistical assumptions and edge cases
- Support both parametric and non-parametric statistical methods
- Handle missing data and outliers appropriately

## QA Test Cases

- Verify `advanced/statistics.py` implements all descriptive statistics correctly
- Test probability distributions (PDF, CDF, sampling) with known parameters
- Confirm hypothesis testing functions with known statistical examples
- Test regression analysis with known datasets and expected results
- Validate correlation and covariance calculations
- Test statistical sampling and confidence interval calculations
- Ensure functions handle edge cases (small samples, outliers, assumption violations)
- Test statistical accuracy against known statistical results
- Verify all functions use centralized validation and error handling
- Test performance with large datasets and memory usage
- Ensure functions follow the same response format as previous story functions
- Test that statistical assumptions are properly validated and communicated
