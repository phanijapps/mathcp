**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create advanced/symbolic.py module with symbolic mathematics functions
- [ ] Implement symbolic expression parsing and creation
- [ ] Implement algebraic manipulation (expand, factor, simplify, collect)
- [ ] Implement equation solving (algebraic, transcendental, differential equations)
- [ ] Implement symbolic integration and differentiation
- [ ] Implement expression substitution and evaluation
- [ ] Implement mathematical expression formatting and display
- [ ] Integrate with existing core validation and error handling

**Next:** Proceed to Task 5: Advanced Mathematical Libraries Setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `advanced/symbolic.py` implements symbolic expression parsing and creation
- [ ] `advanced/symbolic.py` implements algebraic manipulation (expand, factor, simplify)
- [ ] `advanced/symbolic.py` implements equation solving (algebraic, transcendental, differential)
- [ ] Symbolic integration and differentiation implemented
- [ ] Expression substitution and evaluation functions implemented
