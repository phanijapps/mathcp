# Task 6: Integration & API Layer

**Description:**
Integrate all advanced mathematics modules with the existing mathematical tool library API, ensuring backward compatibility and consistent API design patterns from previous stories.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Update api/dispatcher.py to include advanced mathematics functions
- [ ] Ensure all new functions follow existing API design patterns
- [ ] Implement consistent response formatting for advanced mathematical functions
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility with Stories 1 & 2 functions
- [ ] Update main module imports to include advanced mathematics functionality
- [ ] Integrate new validation rules specific to advanced mathematical parameters
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring and resource management for API calls

**Next:** Proceed to Task 7: Testing & Documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `api/dispatcher.py` includes all advanced mathematics functions (calculus, linear algebra, statistics, symbolic)
- [ ] All new functions follow existing API design patterns from previous stories
- [ ] Response formatting is consistent across all mathematical functions
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing mathematical function interfaces
- [ ] Main module imports updated to include advanced mathematics functionality
- [ ] Advanced mathematical parameter validation integrated with existing validation framework
- [ ] Performance monitoring and resource management implemented for computationally intensive operations
- [ ] Mathematical tool library maintains backward compatibility with all previous stories

**Notes:**
- Follow exact API patterns established in Stories 1 & 2 for consistency
- Ensure all advanced mathematical functions are accessible through the unified API
- Maintain existing function signatures and response formats
- Implement proper resource management for memory-intensive operations
- Test integration thoroughly to prevent breaking changes
