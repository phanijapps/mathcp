# Task 1: Scaffold Project Structure

**Description:**
Set up the Python 3.12 project structure for the math_genius library as per the architecture guidelines.

**Progress Notes:**
- [x] Directory structure created: core, arithmetic, algebra, validation modules under mathgenius/
- [x] All __init__.py files present for package recognition
- [x] pyproject.toml created specifying Python 3.12
- [x] Python 3.12 virtual environment created and activated

**Next:** Proceed to Task 2: Core Validation & Error Handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Directory structure matches the architecture (core, arithmetic, algebra, etc.)
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` and virtual environment for Python 3.12 created
- [ ] All `__init__.py` files present for package recognition


**Notes:**
- No code implementation, just scaffolding and environment setup.

## QA Test Cases

- Verify the directory structure matches the architecture (core, arithmetic, algebra, etc.).
- Confirm `pyproject.toml` exists and specifies Python 3.12.
- Ensure a virtual environment is created and activated.
- Check that all necessary `__init__.py` files are present for package recognition.
