# Task 1: Geometric Shapes Module

**Description:**
Implement geometric calculations for standard shapes including area, perimeter, and volume calculations for triangles, circles, rectangles, spheres, cylinders, and other common geometric shapes.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create geometry/shapes.py module with geometric calculation functions
- [ ] Implement area calculations for 2D shapes (triangle, circle, rectangle, polygon)
- [ ] Implement perimeter calculations for 2D shapes
- [ ] Implement volume calculations for 3D shapes (sphere, cylinder, cube, pyramid)
- [ ] Implement surface area calculations for 3D shapes
- [ ] Integrate with existing core validation and error handling

**Next:** Proceed to Task 2: Trigonometric Functions Module

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `geometry/shapes.py` implements area calculations for triangles, circles, rectangles, polygons
- [ ] `geometry/shapes.py` implements perimeter calculations for 2D shapes
- [ ] `geometry/shapes.py` implements volume and surface area calculations for 3D shapes
- [ ] All functions use centralized input validation from `core/validation.py`
- [ ] All functions follow existing API design patterns from Story 1
- [ ] Functions handle edge cases (zero dimensions, negative values) with appropriate errors

**Notes:**
- Use Python 3.12 type hints and follow existing code patterns from Story 1
- Leverage math library for pi, trigonometric calculations where needed
- Ensure floating-point precision handling for geometric calculations

## QA Test Cases

- Verify `geometry/shapes.py` implements area calculations for all specified 2D shapes
- Confirm perimeter calculations work correctly for all 2D shapes
- Test volume and surface area calculations for 3D shapes (sphere, cylinder, cube, pyramid)
- Validate that all functions use centralized validation and error handling
- Test edge cases: zero dimensions, negative values, invalid shape parameters
- Ensure functions follow the same response format as Story 1 arithmetic functions
- Verify floating-point precision handling with known geometric values
- Test that geometric calculations match mathematical formulas and expected results
