# Task 4: Spatial Operations Module

**Description:**
Implement spatial problem-solving functions including angle calculations, geometric transformations, and basic vector operations for 2D and 3D space.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create geometry/spatial.py module with spatial operation functions
- [ ] Implement angle calculations between vectors and lines
- [ ] Implement geometric transformations (rotation, translation, scaling)
- [ ] Implement basic vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product)
- [ ] Implement vector magnitude and normalization functions
- [ ] Implement angle between vectors calculations
- [ ] Integrate with existing core validation and error handling

**Next:** Proceed to Task 5: Integration & API Layer

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `geometry/spatial.py` implements angle calculations between vectors and lines
- [ ] `geometry/spatial.py` implements geometric transformations (rotation, translation, scaling)
- [ ] `geometry/spatial.py` implements vector operations (add, subtract, dot product, cross product)
- [ ] `geometry/spatial.py` implements vector magnitude and normalization
- [ ] Angle between vectors calculations implemented with unit conversion support
- [ ] All functions support both 2D and 3D operations where applicable
- [ ] All functions use centralized input validation from `core/validation.py`
- [ ] Functions handle edge cases (zero vectors, parallel vectors) appropriately

**Notes:**
- Use consistent vector representation (tuples, lists, or Vector objects)
- Implement transformations using matrix operations where appropriate
- Support both 2D and 3D vector operations
- Handle special cases like zero vectors, parallel vectors, perpendicular vectors
- Ensure angle calculations support both degree and radian output
