# Task 3: Coordinate Geometry Module

**Description:**
Implement coordinate geometry functions including distance calculations, midpoint finding, slope calculations, and line intersections for 2D and 3D coordinate systems.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create geometry/coordinates.py module with coordinate geometry functions
- [ ] Implement distance calculations (2D and 3D Euclidean distance)
- [ ] Implement midpoint calculations for 2D and 3D points
- [ ] Implement slope calculations and line equations
- [ ] Implement line intersection calculations
- [ ] Implement point-to-line distance calculations
- [ ] Integrate with existing core validation and error handling

**Next:** Proceed to Task 4: Spatial Operations Module

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `geometry/coordinates.py` implements distance calculations for 2D and 3D points
- [ ] `geometry/coordinates.py` implements midpoint calculations for coordinate pairs
- [ ] `geometry/coordinates.py` implements slope calculations and line equations
- [ ] `geometry/coordinates.py` implements line intersection calculations
- [ ] Point-to-line distance calculations implemented
- [ ] All functions handle both 2D and 3D coordinate systems consistently
- [ ] All functions use centralized input validation from `core/validation.py`
- [ ] Functions handle edge cases (parallel lines, identical points) appropriately

**Notes:**
- Support both 2D (x,y) and 3D (x,y,z) coordinate systems
- Use consistent coordinate representation (tuples or Point objects)
- Handle special cases like parallel lines, vertical lines, identical points
- Ensure floating-point precision handling for coordinate calculations

## QA Test Cases

- Verify `geometry/coordinates.py` implements distance calculations for 2D and 3D points
- Test midpoint calculations with various coordinate pairs
- Confirm slope calculations handle vertical lines and zero slopes correctly
- Test line intersection calculations including parallel and coincident lines
- Validate point-to-line distance calculations with known geometric examples
- Ensure consistent handling of 2D and 3D coordinate systems
- Test edge cases: identical points, parallel lines, vertical lines
- Verify all functions use centralized validation and error handling
- Test coordinate input validation (proper tuple/list format)
- Ensure functions follow the same response format as Story 1 functions
