# Task 1: Calculus Operations Module

**Description:**
Implement calculus functions including differentiation, integration, limit calculations, series expansions, and multivariable calculus operations.

**Progress Notes:**
- [ ] Create advanced/calculus.py module with calculus functions
- [ ] Implement differentiation functions (symbolic and numerical derivatives)
- [ ] Implement integration functions (definite and indefinite integrals)
- [ ] Implement limit calculations for functions
- [ ] Implement series expansions (Taylor, Maclaurin, power series)
- [ ] Implement multivariable calculus operations (partial derivatives, gradients)
- [ ] Integrate with existing core validation and error handling

**Next:** Proceed to Task 2: Linear Algebra Module

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `advanced/calculus.py` implements symbolic and numerical differentiation
- [ ] `advanced/calculus.py` implements definite and indefinite integration
- [ ] `advanced/calculus.py` implements limit calculations with proper handling of indeterminate forms
- [ ] `advanced/calculus.py` implements series expansions (Taylor, Maclaurin, power series)
- [ ] Multivariable calculus operations (partial derivatives, gradients, Hessians) implemented
- [ ] All functions use centralized input validation from `core/validation.py`
- [ ] Functions handle both symbolic expressions and numerical computations
- [ ] All functions follow existing API design patterns from previous stories

**Notes:**
- Use SymPy for symbolic computation and SciPy for numerical methods
- Implement both symbolic and numerical modes for calculus operations
- Handle mathematical expressions as strings or symbolic objects
- Ensure proper error handling for convergence issues and undefined operations
- Support common mathematical functions and expressions
