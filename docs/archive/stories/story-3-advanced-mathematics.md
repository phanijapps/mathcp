2. **Linear Algebra:** Tool supports matrix operations, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, determinants, linear system solving, and vector spaces
3. **Statistics and Probability:** Tool supports descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis
4. **Symbolic Mathematics:** Tool supports symbolic computation, equation manipulation, and mathematical expression simplification

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Mathematical tools from Stories 1 & 2 continue to work unchanged
6. New advanced functions follow existing API design patterns
7. Mathematical tool library maintains backward compatibility
8. Symbolic and numerical computation modes are clearly differentiated

**Quality Requirements:**
9. All advanced mathematical operations are covered by comprehensive test cases
