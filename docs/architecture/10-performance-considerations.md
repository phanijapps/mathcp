# 10. Performance Considerations

## 10.1 Search Performance
- **Startup Time**: Index all tools once at server startup (~100 tools, <5 seconds)
- **Query Time**: Vector search response time <100ms for typical queries
- **Memory Usage**: ChromaDB SQLite backend keeps memory footprint minimal
- **Scalability**: Can handle thousands of tools with sub-second search times

## 10.2 Execution Performance
- **Tool Execution**: Same performance as current implementation (no change)
- **Parameter Validation**: Existing validation system (no performance impact)
- **Result Formatting**: Minimal overhead for response formatting
