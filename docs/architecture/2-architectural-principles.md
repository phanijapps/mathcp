# 2. Architectural Principles
- **Intelligent Tool Discovery:** Use vector search to find the most relevant math tools based on semantic similarity
- **Progressive Complexity:** Start simple (arithmetic/algebra), scale to advanced (calculus, stats)
- **Developer Experience:** Clean, discoverable APIs through intelligent search rather than overwhelming tool lists
- **Security & Data Integrity:** Input validation, error handling, and safe evaluation of expressions
- **Living Architecture:** Designed for easy extension and future interface layers (REST, MCP, etc)
