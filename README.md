# Math Genius üßÆ

A modular, extensible Python 3.12 library for foundational to advanced mathematics, designed for clean API exposure and future integration with frontend or MCP interfaces.

## üåü Overview

Math Genius is a comprehensive mathematical toolkit that spans from basic arithmetic to graduate-level mathematics. It's built with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and integration into various applications.

## üöÄ Features

### üìä Mathematical Domains
- **Arithmetic**: Basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, modulo)
- **Algebra**: Equation solving, factoring, simplifying, expanding
- **Geometry**: Area, perimeter, volume calculations for standard shapes
- **Trigonometry**: Trigonometric functions with unit conversion
- **Calculus**: Differentiation, integration, limits, series
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations, eigenvalues, linear systems
- **Statistics**: Descriptive statistics, distributions, hypothesis testing
- **Symbolic Mathematics**: Symbolic computation and expression manipulation

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights
- **Modular Design**: Each math domain is self-contained and independently importable
- **Unified API**: Consistent interface across all mathematical functions
- **Input Validation**: Centralized validation and error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full Python 3.12 type hints support
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new mathematical domains

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install mathgenius
```

## üîß Quick Start

```python
from mathgenius.api import solve_equation, area_of_circle, differentiate

# Solve algebraic equations
result = solve_equation('x^2 - 4 = 0')
print(result)  # [2, -2]

# Calculate geometric shapes
area = area_of_circle(radius=5)
print(area)  # 78.54

# Perform calculus operations
derivative = differentiate('sin(x)', 'x')
print(derivative)  # cos(x)
```
